## What was it?
The first Star Stable Online cheat that was capable of manipulating raw script-code without too many issues.

This version you can see right now is a remake of the 2019 version I made, just that it's faster, more efficient, has more features, and could execute script code directly from the UI without touching any in-game components (which the 2019 version couldn't do).

## Does it still work?
No, but if you have experience with figuring out Star Stable's new protection for modding, then you can pretty easily get this cheat up and running without all too many issues.

Your biggest headache would most likely end up with finding the correct address for the horse state, and making CVar work as it's required for a lot of this cheats functionality.

## Can I use the code for my own benefits?
Well look at you go Florian Lehmann.

Jokes aside, if you really want to waste your time on this game then I assume yeah? The codebase isn't the cleanest as I didn't have much time to clean it up, but it should give you a huge headstart with a lot of stuff. Also, the URLs involved in it and custom scripting will stay up for as long as I feel like keeping them, so you have plenty of time to make your own modifications or even download the files.

## TLDR
It was a good run cheating on this game, you learn quite a lot about their engine just from spending time looking at the script code, reading the EXE's functions, etc.

Whatever you do with this code is all up to you, I take **no responsibility what-so-ever for your actions with it**.
# Note
You **have** to follow the license attached in the repository, which lists what and what you cannot do with it.

Remember, distributing it may have real-life consequences **if** Star Stable Online AB decides to escalate it and actually go for legal actions (which I highly doubt they wanna do, considering their past with IT-Security is quite shameful for being a game that targets 7-13 year-old children).
